# The COLOR Game

## Prerequisites


## Overview:

A one-player game to test users on their typing, concentration, and memory. Players are presented with a joke that may or may not coordinate with the visual color font. The player must type the color of the word, rather than the color that is spelled by the word. A countdown timer will be set for each round that the player plays, limiting their time to think and forcing time optimization when typing in colors. Highscores for all game history will be stored and presented once the player types an error,

## Audience:

1. startGame():

- Gets triggered when the enter key is pressed
- Checks if the game is starting for the first time @ timeleft =30s
- Starts the timer if condition is met.

2. nextColour():

- Check if there is still time left in the game.
- Make the text entry box.

# Algorithms:

1. Import the necessary modules, including tkinter and random.
2. Create a list of possible colors and initialize the score and the time left.
3. Create a GUI window using tkinter and set the window title and size.
4. Add labels for instructions, score, time left, and color display.
5. Add a text entry box for typing in colors.
6. Start the GUI main loop.
7. During gameplay, display a random color and wait for player input.
8. Check if the typed color matches the displayed color and update the score.
